I did not work but I have already fixed that problem for production. I needed to alter the script to accomodate the decompression. If you have time now I will resent the second to last one and we can try the new version..

Bummer!  I got this error on mainnet too, so I wasted $120. And I need to inscribe the full big file. Looks like it will be $400 ðŸ˜¦  Unless I could get it to work with out the import. I will try something else... Hmm

I am super confused. Maybe you can help me solve this. It is really bothering me.  Here is the inscription I just did: https://www.ord.io/53822471

Which calls the logic file that I compressed with Pako which is listed as a recursive module on the previous page:
https://www.ord.io/53817366

I get the above error on mainnet. This is the statement that is causing the error:

  const pako = await import('/content/fba6f95fb1152db43304a27dce8cb8c65509eba6ab0b6958cedeb33e5f443077i0'); 

Yet this is the approach that is used by other inscriptions. 

e.g., this is taken from another inscription used by on chain monkey. Looks exactly the same to me:
 const pako = await import('/content/fba6f95fb1152db43304a27dce8cb8c65509eba6ab0b6958cedeb33e5f443077i0');

(And I believe that one is being called by a script as well.)

Here are a list of inscriptions that mention pako:
https://studio.geniidata.com/query/90491

Can you help me understand why it is not working for ours?

Inscription 53,822,471 | Ord.io

Inscription 53,817,366 | Ord.io



Thanks for taking a look at it... It certainly has me puzzled...

E.g., this one ord.io/523cbe494d52b1ed6d24180d9066c2fe53f560b00576ee3bf4e2a8d05df9d19fi0

is called by this htm file...

Does not get CORS error.

This is so weird. Look at this : https://static.unisat.io/inscription/content/a555dd2c7e6e97487b83ab768330fd6cbcbf313d9a79075c019b11775b32c83ai0

what is this?
shiftshapr â€” Yesterday at 4:59 AM
This is the inscription - the owl egg. It works with that link which is content link on the Unisat page:
https://unisat.io/inscription/a555dd2c7e6e97487b83ab768330fd6cbcbf313d9a79075c019b11775b32c83ai0. Go to that page, then scroll down and click on Content: link. 

Do you think the Ordicord tech support could help?

before that it says 404 error for this url: https://testnet.ordinals.com/content/fba6f95fb1152db43304a27dce8cb8c65509eba6ab0b6958cedeb33e5f443077i0
Apologies. Looks like i mixed up the mainnet Pako library with the testnet library... That's why 404 and why Pako was undefined. Its confusing with all these versions.

Tested this one: https://testnet.ordinals.com/content/93c0f3d76d98eb43e70c5595eefafd90732d7b712113dc8cb10ad940430cff40i0... So the file

OK this is the spam my arse inscription that uses Pako and works:
https://www.ord.io/53123428
sma_mint.htm is the version that minted (removed references to http://ordinals.com/)

Note that there are transformations that need to happen for the script to after decompression. I had to change them to get them to actually work.

These transformations are in Owlinals files that have "4decomp" in their name
